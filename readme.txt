== Description ==

Hipmob provides hosted live chat for your Wordpress site. You sign up with us, we give you a code, you install the Hipmob Wordpress plugin, activate it, and you can then talk to your users, figure out what they want and what problems they are having, and make them happy. No servers, no extra steps or code to write, wherever the users are, you get to focus on what you do well.

Hipmob for Wordpress seamlessly integrates Hipmob hosted live chat into your Wordpress site, providing options for choosing which Hipmob app to use, the ability to position the chat tab, and simple control over the style and title text.
